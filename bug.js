This bug occurs when using the Expo's `Camera` API with specific device configurations. The error message might not be explicit, but the camera preview fails to load or displays a blank screen. This often happens when certain camera permissions are not correctly set or when there's a mismatch between the requested camera features and the device's capabilities.  It's also possible that this is due to an asynchronous operation within your Camera component that hasn't completed before rendering, leading to unexpected behavior.
