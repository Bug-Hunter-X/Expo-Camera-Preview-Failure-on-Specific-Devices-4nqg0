# Expo Camera Preview Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using Expo's Camera API. On certain devices, the camera preview fails to load, displaying a blank screen instead.  The issue can stem from incorrect permission handling or asynchronous operations within the camera component. This repo provides both the buggy code and a corrected version.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Test on different devices (note that the bug might not occur on all devices).

## Bug Solution

The solution involves carefully handling camera permissions and ensuring asynchronous operations related to camera initialization are completed before attempting to render the camera preview.  The solution also implements better error handling to provide more informative messages to the user.
